    <h2> About HOW</h2>
    <p class="HOW"> Moving to Boston wasn’t solely about attending school; it was also an opportunity to explore the city's beauty. 
        During my first few weeks here, my friends and I made it a point to experience as much of Boston as possible. 
        While the city is undeniably beautiful, we couldn’t ignore the homelessness, the struggles of its people, and other challenges. 
        This inspired me to create a club dedicated to volunteering and making Boston a better place, one act at a time. 
        With the help of my close friends and support from my school, I founded the volunteer club Hands of Wentworth.</p>  
    <p> If you are intrested in hands of wentworth please contact me!</p>
    <p> We hope to grow and collborate with many schools around us </p>
    <p> Many fun projects will be coming out in the next year regarding HOW. Stay tuned!!</p>
